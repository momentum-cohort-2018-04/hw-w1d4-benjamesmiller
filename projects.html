        For his fitst every exhibition in HTML 5, Benjamin was asked to make a site for a Nursery and Garden Supply
        "company" which gave him just a glimpse down the rabbithole, which is the possiblities of modern web development.
        The site is fairly basic in design, however, with time and more experience Benjamin will be able to truely have an
        extent knowledge of HTML to produce more sophistocated web designs. This is merely the begining.
