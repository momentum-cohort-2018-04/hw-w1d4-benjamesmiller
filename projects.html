        For his fitst every exhibition in HTML 5, Benjamin was asked to make a site for a Nursery and Garden Supply
        "company" which gave him just a glimpse down the rabbithole, which is the possiblities of modern web development.
        The site is fairly basic in design, however, with time and more experience Benjamin will be able to truely have an
        extent knowledge of HTML to produce more sophistocated web designs. This is merely the begining.

        The second project that Benjamin worked on was to create was a website for the Happy Valley Anilaml
        Shelter. This project allowed Benjamin to work with the coding language CSS which, before this opportunity, was the 
        very first time Benjamin had worked with the stylistic language. Again, with time and more experience it is expected
        that Benjamin will become more proficient with the code allowing for him to create more complex designs.
